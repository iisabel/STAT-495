# STAT-495
Final Project for STAT 495 (Statistical Consulting)

WORK IS CURRENTLY ONGOING - SET TO COMPLETE DECEMBER 2023

The overall goal of this consulting project is to examine if the stickleback population changes their traits as they move from salt water to fresh water. We also want to look at if these traits change at the same rate based on where they are in the creek. Furthermore, we want to know if the traits remain the same over time by looking at data from 2006 and 2020. Analysis will be done using CFit7 and R.
